{"name":"Automake","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/automake.git","body":"This is Automake, a Makefile generator.  It aims to be portable and\r\nto conform to the GNU Coding Standards for Makefile variables and\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\nSee the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure\r\nand install Automake.\r\n\r\nAutomake is a Perl script.  The input files are called Makefile.am.\r\nThe output files are called Makefile.in; they are intended for use\r\nwith Autoconf.  Automake requires certain things to be done in your\r\nconfigure.ac.\r\n\r\nAutomake comes with extensive documentation; please refer to it for\r\nmore details about its purpose, features, and usage patterns.\r\n\r\nThis package also includes the \"aclocal\" program, whose purpose is\r\nto generate an 'aclocal.m4' based on the contents of 'configure.ac'.\r\nIt is useful as an extensible, maintainable mechanism for augmenting\r\nautoconf.  It is intended that other package authors will write m4\r\nmacros which can be automatically used by aclocal.  The documentation\r\nfor aclocal is currently found in the Automake manual.\r\n\r\nAutomake has a test suite.  Use \"make check\" to run it.  For more\r\ninformation, see the file t/README.\r\n\r\nAutomake has a page on the web.  See:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.gnu.org/software/automake/\r\n\r\nAutomake also has three mailing lists:\r\n\r\n  * automake@gnu.org\r\n    For general discussions of Automake and its interactions with other\r\n    configuration/portability tools like Autoconf or Libtool.\r\n\r\n  * bug-automake@gnu.org\r\n    Where to send bug reports and feature requests.\r\n\r\n  * automake-patches@gnu.org\r\n    Where to send patches, and discuss the automake development process\r\n    and the  design of new features.\r\n\r\nTo obtain more information about these list, or to subscribe to them,\r\nrefer to <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/#mailinglists>\r\n\r\nNew releases are announced to autotools-announce@gnu.org.  If you want to\r\nbe informed, subscribe to that list by following the instructions at\r\n<http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autotools-announce>.\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package,\r\nthat the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1994-2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\r\nany later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
